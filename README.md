# Learning-Scala-Spark

#### This is a collection of code snippets with descriptions in english and translations in R for those of us that are new to Scala/Spark.
#### The purpose is to be able to search through the file with keywords to find snippet examples for a specific task or purpose. The reason I started to create this is because I have found searching on google for simple Scala to be very sparse and vague as well as geared towards software engineers with experience in java (as opposed to people coming from more of a data science background).
